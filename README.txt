Project Name - Student Information & Management System

Languages and Frameworks Used - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, PHP, MySQL.


Description - The purpose of creating this project was to systematically arrange the informations, manage the
              academic results and strictly maintain the privacy of students. Two login panels are in the
              front page. One is for the admin(or admins) and the other is for students. When the admin logs in, 
              he encounters two tabs, one is for viewing the system and the other is for seeing the informations
              as well as editing the system. When the admin enters the view system section he can see the class test
              marks of four rounds of any student just by putting the roll number(only class test marks have been 
              displayed here for the time being). Again, when he enters through the edit system section he gets to view
              the dashboard, add new students, view information of all students as well as edit them, add a new admin, view informations about all
              admins, see academic performance of students as well as edit the performance grades of the students, and even 
              edit informations about himself through the profile nav-item in navbar. In the academic performance section, 
              tabs of class test, semester final and attendance have been put up. Again, when a student enters through the
              student login panel he gets to see his dashboard, edit and see his own informations, he also gets to
              view his academic performances. No student can see the information and academic results of another student,
              he only gets to see his own, so the privacy is maintained. Cookies are saved when someones logs in through
              the panel when 'Remember Me' is checked.
