# Project Name: Student Information & Management System

<br>

## I've developed this project in my 2nd Year for the course 'Software Development Project'. 

<br>

## Description:

* As the name says this project is about students, their information and management.

* CGPA has been dynamically calculated for all the eight semesters individually from class tests (marks taken from 4 class tests through input fields and average mark is determined for best three class tests), attendance, semester final, lab course, quiz, report, board viva and project/thesis/shop practice course marks.

* Admin can very easily process academic results.

* 2 Login Panels are present: Admin Login and Student Login.

* CRUD operations are applied on the informations of student and the admin himself from admin route and some informations can be dynamically changed by the students from student route.

* Privacy of result has been ensured for each student as they can only see their own CGPA and not of anybody else.

* Email verification has been carried out using OTP for student registration.

* Sessions and cookies have been setup.

* On the frontend Bootstrap5 Framework has been used along custom CSS.

* The backend is coded with PHP.

* MySQL Database has been integrated with the backend.
